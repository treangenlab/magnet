# notes on the list of packages:
# PK: scikit-learn and fastani is not listed in the README but is required to run magnet
#   - scikit-learn: version: 0.23.2 works ; later versions need to replace `affinity` with `metric` in the parameters of `AgglomerativeClustering`
#   - ncbi-datasets-cli: version: 17.1.0 works slower probably due to rate control; v15.27.1 mentioned in the README fails with `Error: 429 Too Many Requests`
#                        when calling `datasets download/summary` commands ... 
#   - numpy: version: 1.23.5 works ; later versions have issue with `np.float` deprecated alias for the builtin `float`.
